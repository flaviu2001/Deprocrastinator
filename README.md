# Deprocrastinator

Enjoy this application made at [Polihack 2020](https://www.facebook.com/PoliHack.OSUT/) hackathon over the course of 48 hours. 

It aims to decrease procrastination especially during a pandemic where we are enjoying much more free time. For this you will be motivated to finish subtasks which award you xp and you will see your progression in a graph. Furthermore we implemented bonus points for multiple days of completing tasks in a row and also notifications set at times given by you.
